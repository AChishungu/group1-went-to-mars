Once upan time there was 4 friends with a big dream 
I decided to build a spaceship and swoop my group to take a trip to mars.
The trip took about 3 months. We barely scraped by with food but we made it. Our ship was a little small but we managed. The rooms felt small, it was similar to a college dorm.
